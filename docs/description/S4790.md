Cryptographic hash algorithms such as `MD2`, `MD4`, `MD5`, `MD6`, `HAVAL-128`, `HMAC-MD5`, `DSA` (which uses `SHA-1`), `RIPEMD`, `RIPEMD-128`, `RIPEMD-160`, `HMACRIPEMD160` and `SHA-1` are no longer considered secure, because it is too easy to create hash collisions with them (little computational effort is enough to find two or more different inputs that produces the same hash).

## Ask Yourself Whether

The hashed value is used in a security context like:

- User-password storage.
- Security token generation (used to confirm e-mail when registering on a website, reset password, etc ...).
- To compute some message integrity.


There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

## Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Safer alternatives, such as `SHA-256`, `SHA-512`, `SHA-3` or `bcrypt` are recommended, and for password hashing, it's even better to use algorithms that not compute too "quickly", like `bcrypt` instead of `SHA-256`, because it slows brute force and dictionary based attacks.

## Sensitive Code Example


    Imports System.Security.Cryptography
    
    Sub ComputeHash()
    
        ' Review all instantiations of classes that inherit from HashAlgorithm, for example:
        Dim hashAlgo As HashAlgorithm = HashAlgorithm.Create() ' Sensitive
        Dim hashAlgo2 As HashAlgorithm = HashAlgorithm.Create("SHA1") ' Sensitive
        Dim sha As SHA1 = New SHA1CryptoServiceProvider() ' Sensitive
        Dim md5 As MD5 = New MD5CryptoServiceProvider() ' Sensitive
    
        ' ...
    End Sub
    
    Class MyHashAlgorithm
        Inherits HashAlgorithm ' Sensitive
    
        ' ...
    End Class


## Compliant Solution


    Imports System.Security.Cryptography
    
    Sub ComputeHash()
        Dim sha256 = New SHA256CryptoServiceProvider() ' Compliant
        Dim sha384 = New SHA384CryptoServiceProvider() ' Compliant
        Dim sha512 = New SHA512CryptoServiceProvider() ' Compliant
    
        ' ...
    End Sub
