If a JWT is not signed with a strong cipher algorithm (or not signed at all) an attacker can forge it and impersonate user identities.

- Don't use `none` algorithm to sign or verify the validity of an algorithm.
- Don't use a token without before verifying the signature.


## Noncompliant Code Example

[jwt-dotnet](https://github.com/jwt-dotnet/jwt) library:


    Dim decodedtoken1 As String = decoder.Decode(token, secret, verify:= false) ' Noncompliant: signature should be verified
    
    Dim decodedtoken2 As String = new JwtBuilder().
    &nbsp; &nbsp; WithSecret(secret).
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Decode(forgedtoken1) ' Noncompliant: signature should be verified


## Compliant Solution

[jwt-dotnet](https://github.com/jwt-dotnet/jwt) library:


    Dim decodedtoken1 As String = decoder.Decode(forgedtoken1, secret, verify:= true) ' Compliant
    
    Dim decodedtoken2 As String = new JwtBuilder().
    &nbsp; &nbsp; WithSecret(secret).
    &nbsp; &nbsp; MustVerifySignature().
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Decode(token) ' Compliant
